- **Intermediate Topics**: Move on to design patterns, API development, and Entity Framework Core.
- **Advanced Topics**: Cover complex topics like microservices, distributed systems, and performance optimization.

### 3. Modular Learning Blocks
- **Thematic Modules**: Group related topics into modules (e.g., API Development, Microservices, EF Core, etc.).
- **Progressive Complexity**: Within each module, start with basic concepts and gradually introduce more complex topics.

### 4. Blended Learning Approach
- **Workshops**: Conduct interactive workshops for hands-on experience.
- **Self-paced Learning**: Provide resources for self-study, such as articles, books, and online courses.
- **Group Discussions**: Facilitate discussions where team members can share knowledge and ask questions.

### 5. Practical Application
